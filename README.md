🕸️ **Web Scraping Project 1: Basic Web Scraper** 🕸️

🚀 **Overview**
Welcome to my first web scraping project! 🎉 This project introduces you to the basics of web scraping using Python. We'll scrape a simple website, extract relevant data, and save it to a CSV file. This project is perfect for beginners looking to get started with web scraping and data extraction.

📂 **Project Structure**
Here’s how the project is organized:
Copy
web-scraping-project-1/
├── src/
│   └── main.py
├── data/
│   └── output.csv
└── README.md
src/: Contains the Python script (main.py) that performs the web scraping.
data/: Stores the output CSV file (output.csv) containing the scraped data.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

📚 **Dependencies**
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
requests: For making HTTP requests to the website.
beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML content.
pandas: For data manipulation and saving to CSV.
You can install these dependencies using pip:
bashCopy
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

🛠️ **Setup**
Follow these steps to get started:
Clone the Repository:
bashCopy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-project-1.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:
bashCopy
cd web-scraping-project-1
Install Dependencies:
bashCopy
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
Run the Script:
bashCopy
python src/main.py

🎯 **Usage**
The script main.py performs the following steps:
Fetches the Website Content:
Sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL.
Parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
Extracts Relevant Data:
Extracts data such as titles, links, or any other relevant information from the HTML.
Saves Data to CSV:
Uses pandas to save the extracted data to a CSV file (data/output.csv).

🎯 **Example**
To run the script, simply execute the following command in your terminal:
bashCopy
python src/main.py
This will scrape the specified website and save the extracted data to data/output.csv.

📝**Notes**
URL Modification: You can modify the URL in main.py to scrape different websites.
Data Extraction: Customize the data extraction logic in main.py to scrape different elements from the website.
Permissions: Ensure you have permission to scrape the website and comply with its robots.txt file.
